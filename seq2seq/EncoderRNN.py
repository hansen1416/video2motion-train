    We initialize this module to be bidirectional,
    meaning that we have two independent GRUs:
    one that iterates through the sequences in chronological order, and another that iterates in reverse order.
    We ultimately return the sum of these two GRUsâ€™ outputs.

    To batch variable-length sentences,
    we allow a maximum of MAX_LENGTH tokens in a sentence,
    and all sentences in the batch that have less than MAX_LENGTH tokens are padded at the end
    with our dedicated PAD_token tokens.

    Encoding the input sequence is straightforward:
    simply forward the entire sequence tensor and its corresponding lengths vector to the encoder.
    It is important to note that this module only deals with one input sequence at a time, NOT batches of sequences.
    Therefore, when the constant 1 is used for declaring tensor sizes, this corresponds to a batch size of 1.
